# eddi-diverter-export-margin-analysis
Public copy of data and outputs from 2022-08 analysis of likely optimal Eddi PV diverter Energy Margin level in PV / battery / heat-battery system

See paper at https://www.earth.org.uk/eddi-diverter-export-margin-analysis.html

The conclusion was to raise (at the end of 2022-08, manually via the control panel) the fixed eddi Export Margin
from 100W ro 400W nominal, expecting that to be more grid-friendly in a number of ways,
without any significant loss of DHW from diversion.
